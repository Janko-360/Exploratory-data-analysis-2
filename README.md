### Data visualization for 3 weather station sensors from the City of Chicago 

Data source: from data.world [City of Chicago, Beach Weather Stations - Automated Sensors](https://data.world/cityofchicago/beach-weather-stations-automated-sensors)

**Motivation** for this project was to get some experience with real world sensor data. Especially data cleaning in Excel. And then start my first project in Tableau. 

Data was cleaner than I hopped.  
The date was messed up. Partway through, the format changed and I had to extract date, month, year and time. And then recompile into the standard format. 

There was a upgrade period for the temperature sensor. There I tried to fill the empty data with 0 and average to see how it will work. 

**Cleaning data** sheet contains the detailed inspection of all fields and  
**Cleaned data** has the data separated by year. Thought it might help with the presentation, however, in the end all data was combined into one table.
